High-School-IST-Programming-Project-2010
========================================

I created a Frogger-esque game for my Year 10 IST programming project,
written in 2010.

The program is written in BASIC, all the code is contained in game.bas
and is overly commented (as my teacher wanted just about everything to be commented...)
